## Big O 

**Big O** is used to describe the performance or efficiency of an algorithm. 


## Time complexity 

**Time Complexity** is a measure of the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, typically expressed in terms of input size. 

## Space Complexity** 

**Space Complexity** is a measure of the amount of memory or storage space required by an algorithm to solve problem.
